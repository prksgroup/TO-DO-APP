# TO-DO-APP
#javascript #nodejs #express js

This is an todo web application which is completely coded on NODE.JS,EXPRESS.JS,MONGODB,JAVASCRIPT,HTML,CSS,PASSPORT.JS,AJAX,JQUERY,JSON.

In this web application user can make their own todo list and delete it after completion of work by marking it with an checkbox anytime .

The whole work is been stored in MONGODB database.

I have used VISUAL STUDIO CODE IDE for developing this web application .

The whole code structure of the web application is structured on MVC(MODEL VIEWS CONTROLLER).
